{"text":"Yes, it does depend on the type of rice. For a white rice, I usually use Jasmine. The pot I use to cook rice in has a glass lid so I can check it without removing the lid. For 3 cups of cooked rice, rinse 1 cup of uncooked rice and let drain while you bring 2 cups of water to a boil. You could add 1 tsp. chicken, beef or vegetable bouillon base for flavoring if you want. Once the water comes to a boil, stir in the rice, cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook 15 - 20 minutes until all of the water has evaporated. If your pot has a glass lid, you can just tilt the pot to see if any water remains. Once done, remove from the heat and let rest until ready to serve.","meta":{"source":"GPT3.5 Few Shot

I've made it half a dozen times and it always turns out great. I add mushrooms and black olives as toppings. You'll see a comment chain from me on the pizza yeast, I can tell you it's not necessary. As OP said, fast-acting yeast of any kind works. What *is* necessary (to me, anyway) is brushing the top of the exposed crust on the sides liberally with butter or olive oil. Otherwise that part dries out into a cracker-like consistency.
